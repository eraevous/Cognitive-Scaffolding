# Module: core.workflows.insurance_verification
> High-level workflow that loads verification files, invokes the parser, and persists normalized policy records.

### 游꿢 Intent & Responsibility
- Iterate over one or more input files and associated mapping configs.
- Delegate extraction to `core.parsing.insurance_verification` with appropriate LLM settings.
- Store or return aggregated records for downstream analysis or search.

### 游닌 Inputs & 游닋 Outputs
| Direction | Name | Type | Brief Description |
|-----------|------|------|-------------------|
| 游닌 In | files | List[str] | Paths to verification forms |
| 游닌 In | mapping | Dict[str, str] | Mapping configuration shared across files |
| 游닌 In | model | str | Target model identifier for `langchain_router` |
| 游닋 Out | records | List[Dict[str, Any]] | List of standardized policy dictionaries |

### 游댕 Dependencies
- `core.parsing.insurance_verification`
- `core.llm.langchain_router`
- `core.storage.upload_local` or similar persistence layer

### 游뱋 Integration Points
- Upstream CLI command may call this pipeline.
- Downstream vector store or metadata modules consume resulting records.
- Potential agent-hub role to validate extracted fields.
