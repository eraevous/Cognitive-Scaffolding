description: >
  Foundational schema for multi-agent, memory-structured GPT workflows using Cells, Threads, Frames, and Forks.

## === Glossary Definitions ===
glossary:
  cell:
    definition: "An atomic interactionâ€”one input (prompt) and one output (response)."
    aliases: ["message pair", "turn", "unit"]
  thread:
    definition: "A linear sequence of Cells forming a coherent dialogue or process."
    notes: "Assumes linear progression unless forked."
  frame:
    definition: "A bounded, context-rich memory object, composed of selected Cells and metadata."
    use_cases: ["summary memory", "context injection", "recall block"]
  film:
    definition: "A stylized or annotated version of a Thread, often organized thematically or narratively."
    related_to: ["thread"]
  fork:
    definition: "A new Thread that branches from a previous Cell or Frame within a parent Thread."
    notes: "Used for nonlinear exploration, tangent development, or speculative divergence."
  branch:
    definition: "A named or labeled forked Thread from a parent Node."
  node:
    definition: "Any Cell designated as a forking point."
