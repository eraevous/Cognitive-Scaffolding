@ai-intent: Document stubbing strategy for new pipeline tests

- Added pytest coverage for the pipeline orchestrator while avoiding optional heavy dependencies.
- Injected temporary config JSON and stub modules (`tiktoken`, `faiss`, `openai`) within the test harness to prevent import failures.
- Confirmed focus on orchestration behavior (calls to upload/classify/embed) without exercising external services.
