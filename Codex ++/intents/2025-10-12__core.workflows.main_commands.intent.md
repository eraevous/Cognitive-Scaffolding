@ai-intent: Capture classify() refactor into modular helpers for workflow clarity

- Broke monolithic `classify()` logic into `detect`, `segment`, `summarize`, `merge_stubs`, and `persist` helpers to expose testable seams.
- Preserved existing summarization heuristics (chatlog detection, semantic fallback to paragraph chunking) while isolating IO + validation.
- Expect downstream callers (CLI, batch, pipeline) to continue using `classify()` wrapper with no signature change.
