- context: Adding planning scaffolds for insurance verification pipeline.
- decision: Introduced `.purpose.md` stubs for LLM router, insurance parser, and workflow.
- rationale: Need LangChain/MCP compatibility and support for local Mistral 7B and Bedrock models before implementing extraction logic.
- open-questions: Define mapping doc schema; evaluate latency of local models; MCP tool invocation requirements.
