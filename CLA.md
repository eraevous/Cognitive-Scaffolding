# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for contributing to Cognitive-Scaffolding / Kairos! üéâ  
This Contributor License Agreement (‚ÄúCLA‚Äù) clarifies how contributions are licensed and how they may be used.

---

## 1. Open Source License
All contributions you submit to this project are licensed under the project‚Äôs open source license, found in [LICENSE](LICENSE) (MIT/Apache-2.0).  
This ensures that the project remains free and open for everyone to use, extend, and share.

---

## 2. Contributor Rights
- You **retain copyright** to your contributions.  
- You may reuse your contributions anywhere else under any license you choose.  
- You do not assign your rights away by contributing.

---

## 3. Grant to Maintainer (Zachary Rhodes)
To support the sustainability of this project, you grant Zachary Rhodes:
- The right to **relicense contributions for commercial use**, including creating proprietary or dual-licensed versions of the software.
- This right is **non-exclusive** (you still own your work) and **royalty-free**.
- It only applies to contributions you make to this repository.

## 4. No Warranty
Contributions are provided ‚Äúas-is‚Äù and without warranty. You are not liable for downstream use.

## 5. How This Affects You
- **If you are an individual contributor:** your code remains open-source under MIT/Apache, but the maintainer may also bundle it in a commercial product.  
- **If you are a company using the project:** you can freely build on the open-source version, but proprietary improvements you make will only remain yours if you don‚Äôt upstream them. Contributed patches follow this CLA.  
- **If you want to opt out:** simply don‚Äôt submit contributions ‚Äî you can still use the project under MIT/Apache.

By submitting a pull request, issue, or patch, you confirm that:
1. You have the rights to contribute the code/content.  
2. You agree to the terms above.
