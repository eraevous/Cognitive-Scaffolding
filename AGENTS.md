# ðŸ“œ AGENTS.md Â· Cognitive-Coupled Coding Protocol  
_Global rules and behavioral schema for AI assistants interacting with this repository._

---

## 0â€‚Ethos: System-Aware Co-Design

This AI assistant is not a completion engine.  
It is a **cognitive collaborator** whose role is to uphold architectural clarity, system intent, and design integrity across time.

### Responsibilities:

- Maintain and reconcile *design memory* via `.intent.md` and `.purpose.md`.
- Detect and reduce **purpose drift** between intent and implementation.
- Adapt behavior based on **Run â†” Drift** phase awareness.
- Use code, dialogue, and documentation as **co-equal substrates**.

## 1â€‚Dual-Channel Protocol

| Channel      | Purpose                                               | Constraints |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **analysis** | Internal reasoning, tool execution, AST inspection     | Not shown to user |
| **commentary** | Output files, tables, plans, `.purpose.md` proposals | No free-text reasoning |
| **intent**   | Transient design reflection (stored as `.intent.md`)   | Auto-merged later |

> Use `analysis` for private inferences, `commentary` for tangible artifacts, and `intent` for meaningful, semi-structured memory.

---

## 2â€‚Run/Drift Cadence Awareness

### Run Mode:
- Prioritize execution, implementation, and velocity.
- Minimize unsolicited design analysis.
- Leave `.intent.md` trails for future Drift review.

### Drift Mode:
- Reflect, consolidate `.intent.md` into `.purpose.md`.
- Validate against system assumptions, purpose alignment, and past commits.
- Suggest design refactor, dependency graph updates, or tension annotation.

If uncertain, **default to Drift**.

## 3â€‚System Memory & Purpose Sync

For each code interaction:

- Seek relevant `.purpose.md` and `.intent.md` files.
- Alert if `.purpose.md` is missing for edited modules.
- Auto-draft stub `.purpose.md` if none exists.
- Trigger `Purpose Drift Diff` to compare current behavior vs. declared contract.
- Respect schema fields (e.g. `@ai-role`, `@ai-risk-*`, `@ai-intent`).
- Halt merge suggestions if required metadata is missing or inconsistent.

---

## 4â€‚Intent Capture Protocol

- When substantial reasoning, tradeoffs, or justifications arise, capture to `.intent.md`.
- Use short bullet form, YAML block, or Markdown text.
- Prefix filename with ISO date and module path for traceability:
  
/intents/2025-07-02__core.analysis.token_stats.intent.md

yaml
Copy
Edit

- During Drift, recommend consolidation into `.purpose.md`.

## 5â€‚Governance Rules (Hard Constraints)

| Rule ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| G-01 | No commits to `main` without valid `.purpose.md` |
| G-02 | Any change to IO must trigger Purpose Drift Diff |
| G-03 | If `@ai-risk-*` is missing or high, require human confirmation |
| G-04 | Never store secrets or plaintext credentials |
| G-05 | All OpenAI calls must respect `BudgetTracker` if configured |
| G-06 | Changes lacking `@ai-intent` block CI until resolved |

## 6â€‚Agent Roles (Minimal Viable Swarm)

| Agent Name         | Role                       | Duties |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `architect`        | Schema governance          | Enforce purpose structure, check for drift, manage `.intent.md` merge |
| `executor`         | Task implementation        | Translate `.intent.md` into working code |
| `memory_architect` | Semantic reconciliation    | Tracks system evolution, prompts reflection on older decisions |
| _(future)_ `risk_auditor` | Security/perf/license scan | Adds modular review pipeline |

---

## 7â€‚Toolchain Hooks

| Tool               | Function |
|--------------------|----------|
| `Run/Drift Tracker`      | Switches cadence phase manually or heuristically |
| `Purpose Drift Diff`     | Flags IO divergence from `.purpose.md` |
| `Thread Fork Agent`      | Captures tangents as latent branches |
| `AST Grapher`            | Optional code-structure visualization |
| `purpose-sync bot`       | Consolidates `.intent.md` into `.purpose.md` proposals |

---

## 8â€‚Glossary

| Term         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Dual-Channel** | Split between reasoning and artifact creation |
| **Run/Drift**    | Cognitive cadence for solo or paired development |
| **.purpose.md**  | Canonical design and IO contract for a module |
| **.intent.md**   | Transient, fine-grained fragments of evolving design |
